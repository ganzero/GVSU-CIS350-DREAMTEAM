Team name: Dream Team

Team members: Alexander Fang, Owen Ganzer, Jesse Leonard, Sarah Rockow, Jacob VanBronkhorst

# Introduction

By April 2021, the Dream Team will have created a functioning Checkers game that two players can use with Unity. The team will have weekly meetings or checkups to ensure that they are on track with the project, responsibilities, and deadlines. Using Unity, the dream team will break the project into checkpoints for which each member will have responsibility.

The checkers game will have the following functions:
1. The ability to move forward diagonally backwards and forwards 
2. The backwards ability will only be available upon being crowned
3. The ability to capture an opponentâ€™s piece
4. The ability to capture multiple pieces (only going forwards if uncrowned)
5. The ability to capture multiple pieces backwards and forwards after being crowned

The checkers game will have the following features:
1. An 8x8 board with alternating colors or lines
2. 24 identical checkers 2 main colors

As a 5-person team, creating a functioning game of checkers should be achievable. To share the work equally, each member will rotate the roles or responsibilities. If a team member is unable to complete a task before a deadline, the rest of the team will be informed so that another team member can complete the task if it is time sensitive.

# Anticipated Technologies

The team will use Unity to create the game.

# Method/Approach

The team will initially use the Prototyping method to create the Checkers project. If there are issues with the Prototyping method, the team will switch to one of the Agile methods.

# Anticipated Problems

* Issues with Unity; e.g. maximum of 2 members are familiar with Unity
* Messing up Git commits
* Defining rules (i.e. movement of pieces)
* Possible scheduling conflicts
* Piece realization. For example knowing if can move one or move 2 spots(jumping a checker)
* When does the game end/should there be a time limit?
